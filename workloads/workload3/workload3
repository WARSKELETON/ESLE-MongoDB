# Yahoo! Cloud System Benchmark
# Workload 3: Small cardinality consistent data for 2 days
#   Application example: Typical monitoring of a single compute or small 
#   sensor station where 90% of the load is write and only 10% is read 
#   (it's usually much less). All writes are inserts. No sparsity so 
#   every series will have a value at every timestamp.
#
#   Read/insert ratio: 10/90
#   Cardinality: 16 per key (field), 64 fields for a total of 1,024 
#                time series.
